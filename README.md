This is a student project created by Olive Arderius, Joelle Asante, and Daisy Trejo Hernandez as part of Cornell's Break Through Tech AI program. With this project are various repositories, all meant to work together to create a machine learning model for predicting air quality. This model is meant to help people in New York City to have a better idea of coming air quality issues and be able to prepare better, as well as spread information and awareness of the issues related to poor AQI.
The epa repo contains a jupyter notebook (and a processed data file, if everything went well) that processes data and then creates an ARIMA model based on it. The dataset used is from the EPA and is too large to include here, but it can be easily found online.
The kaggle and openAQ repos attempt to do similar things but with different datasets. They can all be looked at individually.

The accuracy of these models is questionable at best. They mostly only really capture averages and general trends and should not be actually used to seriously predict air quality. Google has models that do the same but better, so you should probably use those.

The timeline for this project is over, and it is no longer being worked on. If this project were to continue, the next steps would be to properly troubleshoot SARIMA and better use all of the datasets together.

To use this, just go on each project and find the .ipynb file. They can all be run directly as long as you have the data, with possible fixes needed to properly import the files.

I don't recommend contributing to this project. You can if you want to, but since the project is no longer being worked on I doubt much will happen.

I truly don't know what license was used here, but I guess do what you want.
